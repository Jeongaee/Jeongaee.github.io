        <p><li>Twilight</li></p>
        <p>Genres: Drama | Fantasy | Romance </p>
        <p>Release Date: 21 November 2008 (USA)</p>
        <p>Short description: Bella Swan has always been a little bit different.<br> Never one to run with the crowd, Bella never cared about fitting in with the<br> trendy girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother remarries<br>and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks,<br> Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. But things do<br> change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen.<br> For Edward is nothing like any boy she's ever met. He's nothing like anyone<br> she's ever met, period. He's intelligent and witty, and he seems to see<br>straight into her soul. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate<br> and decidedly unorthodox romance - unorthodox because Edward really isn't like<br>the other boys. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving<br>car with his bare hands. Oh, and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires,<br>he's immortal. That's right - vampire. But he doesn't have fangs - that's just<br>in the movies. And he doesn't... </p>

        <p>Short description: Welcome to a world where time has become the ultimate<br>currency. You stop aging at 25, but there's a catch: you're<br>genetically-engineered to live only one more year, unless you can buy your way<br> out of it. The rich "earn" decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming<br>essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours to make it<br>through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely<br>accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living<br> minute to minute, the duo's love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system.</p>
